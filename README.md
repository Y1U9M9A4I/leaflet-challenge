# Module 15 Challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

# Create the Earthquake Visualization #
In part 1 of this assignment, we are tasked with using USGS earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. The selected data is imported and visualized. We: 

- Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from this dataset based on longitude & latitude. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquakes by their size (earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger).  and the depth of the earthquakes by color (earthquakes with greater depth are darker in color).
- Also included are popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
